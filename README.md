# Machine Learning Project

## Description
This project involves the implementation of machine learning algorithms for various tasks, including classification, regression, and clustering. We explore techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Neural Networks.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
